# Compiling

First of all, place your `stranded2_en` folder in the root of this repo.

Then, run cmake:

### Windows
I would recommend you to install `MinGW-x64` and `CMake-GUI` for compiling.

Currently, I don't have Windows PC, so if you want to help, feel free to write a compilation process here.

### UNIX
On Linux and macOS this should do the work
```
./build.sh
```

After successfull compilation, you will get the executable file in `stranded2_en` folder. Done!
