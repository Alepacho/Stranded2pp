# Main project TODO list

## High priority
ASAP!

* Add details to this list
* Rewrite Input system to use std::function callbacks (instead of *Handler-derived objects)
* Decide about Modification class and some resource manager
* Rewrite all the trash
* [Done] Move to CMake build system

## Medium priority
Just after High priority tasks

* Write COMPILING.md

## Low priority
U probably got that logic

* Add support for original `moon_a.png` and `flames0_a.png` sprites
* Add support for mp3 files (or wait for SFML to do so?)
